# Summary

After experiencing and watching people being on calls for few months, I created
a package where oncalls might be human less. Recently this has become huge area
for distributed computing researches. In this paper we publish 190GB of sample
on call alarms that humans receive. We have picked the information from AWS Clusters,
PagerDuty APIs, Elastic Search Watcher, HP Sitescope and many more alarm delivering
service. We publish a poll where we asked companies in different areas on how they
implement urgency and escalation for anything in their organisation. How much Pagers
help them in implementing them, this can be any scenario. We have made machine learning
implementation where the alarms response are learned from humans action. Any alarm
goes in a pipeline with 0 and 1. The 0 machine are responded using multi fixes than
1 which are fixed using our implementation. As futher implementataion we publish
a service where using our APIs you can make any of your Pagers response human less, we are just keeping out doctors pagers obviously.
